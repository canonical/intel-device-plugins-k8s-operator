title: Intel Device Plugins K8s Operator
summary: An operator for Intel device enablement for Kubernetes.
description: |
  This operator manages Intel device plugins for Kubernetes.

  Specifically, it is a custom controller for serving the installation
  and lifecycle of Intel device plugins for use within Kubernetes pods.
  Supported devices include the Intel GPU, FPGA, QAT, SGX, DSA, and DLB.

  This is useful for Kubernetes-based workloads that depend on Intel devices
  for enabling or enhancing their function, e.g. a machine learning application 
  that runs faster on a discrete Intel GPU.

  The operator may be useful to developers, engineers, or hobbyists searching
  for streamlined device enablement on their local machines, or to cluster
  administrators in need of a single point of control for managing their
  various devices.
